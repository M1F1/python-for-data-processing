    "* I strongly recommend learning something new during the project, for instance:\n",
    "    * New API (flickr, YELP, twitter and many others make public their API)\n",
    "    * Interesting python package (interactive plotting! like holoviews or plotly)\n",
    "    * Specific ML algorithm/problem (we only looked at linear regression, so barely scratched the surface)\n",
